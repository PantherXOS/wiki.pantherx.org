**If you are running PantherX Desktop, this is configured out of the box.**

Our desktop search is powered by Recoll. It's blazing fast and does full-test search so even if you're looking for a phrase in a PDF, document, email or any other supported file-type, you're covered.

Here's how you access it:

1. Open the applications menu
2. Go to Accessories > Recoll

Start searching!

### Settings

Here's where you configure your defaults:

- Directories: These are all locations that are indexed. If you want Wiki search to work, you should leave that `px-wiki..` entry.
- Skipped names
- Excluded MIME types
- Skipped paths
