description: "Ruby Version Manager, often abbreviated as RVM, is a unix-like software platform designed to manage multiple installations of Ruby on the same device. The entire ruby environment including the Ruby interpreter, installed RubyGems, and documentation is partitioned. A developer can then switch between the different versions to work on several projects with different version requirements."
