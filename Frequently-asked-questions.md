## General

### What is PantherX Linux?

PantherX is a modern, Unix-like  computer operating system, designed to enable everyone without a PHD in computer science, to take control of their computer, data and privacy, and exercise their right to freedom of monitoring and tracking.

### What architectures does PantherX support?

PantherX comes in two flavours, with notable differences:

1. _x86-64_ is a unsupported (but stable), rolling-release similar to _Arch Linux_ where we test new features
2. _ARM_ is our supported, LTS (long term stable) release, specifically designed for PantherX

### I am a complete GNU/Linux beginner. Should I use PantherX?

Yes, PantherX has been designed, specifically designed for end-user, no matter whether you're an existing GNU/Linux user, or are migrating from Mac OSX or Windows. You'll feel right at home, with PantherX.

### Is PantherX designed to be used as a server? A desktop? A workstation?

PantherX is configured entirely using a [system configuration](/System-configuration/) file, that means, it can be used for anything, anywhere. By default, PantherX features a fully configured, ready to use desktop environment, however, on a fresh installation, you may opt for a more lightweight configuration. In fact, given Panther's nature, you can even re-configure an existing desktop, into a server OS - completely clean, and in minutes.

### When will the new release be made available?

The release cycle depends on the release you're running:

- _x86-64_ is a rolling-release, and receives updates as soon as they become available
- _ARM_ is a LTS release, and receives security updates immediately, and schedules major changes for _when they are ready (TM)_.

### Is PantherX Linux a stable distribution? Will I get frequent breakage?

Our flagship _ARM_ release should never break and is tested extensively, on [Panther Alpha](/Panther-Alpha/), but even the _x86-64_ based, rolling-release should be at least as stable, as an _Arch Linux_ based installation. Unlike _Arch Linux_, you can always roll-back, in a matter of seconds, even if your kernel breaks.
