**If you are running PantherX Desktop, this is configured out of the box.**

Software is the best place to find, install and manage your applications. Software also keeps all your applications up to date, and informs you when operating system updates are available.

The interface is divided in 3 parts:

1. "Store": This is where you can find new applications
2. "Your Apps": This is where you can manage all applications you have installed as user
3. "System" This is where you can update your operating system
